        <p>We build privacy that works for everyone. Protecting our users’ privacy and security is a responsibility that comes with creating products and services that are free of cost and accessible for all. This is especially important as technology progresses and safety needs evolve. We look to these principles to guide our products, our processes, and our people in keeping our users’ data private, safe, and secure.</p>

                Respect our users.
                Respect their privacy.</p>
            <p>We believe these ideas are inseparable. Together, they represent a single, core belief that has influenced everything we’ve made since day one, and everything we’ll make moving forward. When people use our products, they trust us with their information, and it’s our job to do right by them. This means always being thoughtful about what data we use, how we use it, and how we protect it.</p>
